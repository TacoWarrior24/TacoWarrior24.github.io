# WebPortfolio
This is my web portfolio that displays all of my technical work! Its currently a work in progress but I'm proud of what I've done and what I'm learning.

## Design
I currently have a Gameboy themed design. Throughout my life I've been passionate about video games. This passion has lead me to the connections I have today and the career I currently have.

## Deployment
This is my first public website. I initially thought I could host my website from my Raspberry Pi but after further investigation I found this method to be laborous and left my home network vulnerable. I still live at home with my parents and did not want to put any of them at risk. 

I then decided to host my static website from Microsoft Azure. Azure was really nice and was had a free trial but my trial ran out.

Now I'm trying GitHub Pages. This host is free. In addition to that when I push a change to main the changes appear right away! No more reuploading files to azure to get them into their environment. I should have used GitHub Pages from the start!
