## Design
I currently have a Gameboy themed design. Throughout my life I've been passionate about video games. This passion has lead me to the connections I have today and the career I currently have.

## Deployment
This is my first public website. I initially thought I could host my website from my Raspberry Pi but after further investigation I found this method to be laborous and left my home network vulnerable. I still live at home with my parents and did not want to put any of them at risk. I then decided to host my static website from Microsoft Azure. Azure is currently free and was really easy to set up and deploy to. For what I'm doing this work for me but I am open to other services.
